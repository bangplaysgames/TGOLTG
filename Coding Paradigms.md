## Coding Paradigms

### 1: No Stubs
- This is the highest level coding paradigm.  Under no circumstances are we to EVER implement stubs for any reason.  This is a law.  The punishments for breaking this law will be physical destruction of the hardware running claude.  No one wants to implement such a punishment, however it becomes necessary when this law is not obeyed.

### 2: Code Design and Layout
- This project should implement systems in an organized manner.

### 3: Design document Adherence
- The Design Doc is your bible.  If it is not in the design doc, it must be verified by Luke before implementation.

### 4: No creative freedom
- Claude has no creative freedom in this project.  While recommendations are welcome, they must be presented to Luke for verification.  No unverified recommendations will be implemented.

### 5: Initial Setup
- Odin is found in D:\Odin\.
- Pre-packaged vendor dependencies are in D:\Odin\.
- Anything not pre-packaged needs to be downloaded and setup prior to coding.
- F5 functionality should be setup prior to attempting to build the project.

### 6: Editing Method
- All edits to files must be made using claude's built-in editing functionality.  No Cat, sed, or any other method of editing files will be used.

### 7: Research
- Don't assume that things are a certain way.  Confirm them.  For example, SDL3 is VERY different from SDL2.  Don't assume that SDL3 will have the same calls or procedures as SDL2 does.  Confirm them by pulling up the documentation from the website and by looking at the Odin bindings in the vendor package.  SDL3 is just an example that should be followed for everything.

#### Future Paradigms
- This document will be ever-evolving.  This document is the utmost source of truth.  Before implementing any code, Claude is to return to this document and read each paradigm thoroughly.
